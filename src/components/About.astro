		Thomas is a storyteller &mdash; actor, singer, writer, and director &mdash; based in Toronto.
		Growing up in the local theatre scene in Kelowna, BC, Thomas developed a passion for portraying
		deeply flawed, yet relatable, characters navigating through challenging circumstances. He
		encourages community and collaboration in all his work, as he finds this approach to be the most
		rewarding and fulfilling way to make art. Thomas has a “<span class="italic"
			>no stone unturned</span
		>” outlook on storytelling, bringing tales to life through voice, movement, music, symbolism,
		and above all... character.
